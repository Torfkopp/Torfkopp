### About Mario
- Mario does not need to know about class factory pattern. He can instantiate interfaces.
- Mario doesn't need garbage collection because he doesn't call .Dispose(), he calls .DropKick().
- The programs that Mario writes don't have version numbers because he only writes them once. If a user reports a bug or has a feature request, he doesn't live to see the sun set.
