### About Mario
- The programs that Mario writes don't have version numbers because he only writes them once. If a user reports a bug or has a feature request, he doesn't live to see the sun set.
- Mario doesn't have disk latency because the hard drive knows to hurry the hell up.
- Mario can binary search unsorted data.
